              I&apos;m Tettei Shahday-Annang. I build highly performant,
              scalable and production-ready web applications. In the past 7
              years I&apos;ve built wordpress-based websites on part time basis,
              helping put online websites for individuals and small businesses.
              I decided to learn JavaScript so I can take on React, and I was
              blown away by its awesomeness. Since then, I haven&apos;t looked
              back. Creating and fixing things on the web has become my main job
              now.
            </p>
            <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
              I spend most of my day experimenting with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
              (and it&apos;s endless list of frameworks). I enjoy coding and the
              challenge of learning something new everyday.
